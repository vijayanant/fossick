Last week I gave a talk at [The Bangalore Haskell User Group]
(https://www.meetup.com/The-Bangalore-Haskell-User-Group/) on using GADTs to
bring compile time correctness to Haskell programs. The focus of the talk was
more towards advocating using Haskell type system features where possible to
simplify code. The aim was to show  how error handling code can be
avoided/removed and still achieve type-safety.

The presentation used for the talk is available
[here](/presentations/gadt.pdf).

I had written a more detailed writeup on the same topic [here]({{<ref
"/posts/gadt.md">}}).
