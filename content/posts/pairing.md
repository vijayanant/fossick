### What?
Simply put, pair programming is two programmers with a single computer working
together to solve a problem!

### Why?

* To produce better code
* To learn more from your peers
* To learn and practice objectively evaluating possible solutions
* To collaborate with better programmers

### How?

* **The Driver** is responsible to coding (owns the keyboard)
* **The Navigator** is responsible for reviewing the driver’s work
* **30 min Rule**: Role changes every 20-30min (at a logical break point)
* **Take control of the worl.. err.. keyboar** - you drive when you know what to do

### Common Sense

* Respect your peer’s time
* Collective ownership - Be a team player 
* Communication - Talk to you peer (Speak your mind)
* Let-go/grab the keyboard when required
* Let go of your ego, be humble
* Enjoy coding
