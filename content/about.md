I'm a software engineer working and living in [Bengaluru,
India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore).

I write this blog to document and share my thoughts about new concepts,
philosophies, problems, and tools that I encounter and learn in my everyday
work. I want to share my experience in the hope that others can avoid similar
mistakes and struggles.

I believe that the best way to learn something is by sharing that knowledge
publicly. You will see that many topics that I write here are notes for myself
in the future.

All of the blog posts are my own opinions.
