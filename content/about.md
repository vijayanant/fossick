Hey there, I'm Vijay. I'm a Software Architect living in [Bengaluru, India]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). I love coffee, and programming. In my
free time, other than coding, you will find me watching anime or reading manga.

I believe writing about something is one of the best ways to get better
understanding on anything. By writing here I hope to better myself along the
way. I will be happy if this helps someone else too.

You can reach out to me either on [twitter](https://twitter.com/vijayanant) or
[email] (mailto:vijay.hassan@gmail.com).
